# Visualisation Exercise

The dataset we are using for this assignment is from the 2019 World Happiness Survey available through the Open Data Science website **Kaggle**. This is a very large dataset with a number of variables. We have reduced it slightly to make it easier to work with for this assignment and you will see the data you need in your assignment zip folder, called ```Happiness2019.csv```. If you want to explore the dataset fully then you can do so later through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness" target = "_blank">Kaggle by clicking this link</a>.



## Let's Begin

### Task 1 - Library

In the `T01` code chunk, type in code that will load the `tidyverse` into your library.


```{r T01, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

### Task 2 - Read in data

In the `T02` code chunk, using `read_csv`, replace the `NULL` to read in the `Happiness2019.csv` dataset. Store the data in `happy19`.


```{r T02, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
happy19 <- read_csv("Happiness2019.csv")

```

### Task 3 - Scatterplot 1

In the `T03` code chunk, replace the `NULL`s to create a scatterplot depicting Happiness Score (y-axis) as a function of Social Support (x-axis). Create this as a scatterplot with a **black and white themed** background to the figure, and with every data point shown as a **red filled dot**. Each data point must be the same shade of color and not one lighter or darker than the other. 


```{r T03}
ggplot(happy19, aes(x = Social.Support, y = Happiness.Score)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Task 4 - Interpretation 1

In the `T04` code chunk, replace the `NULL` with the number of the statement below that is true, storing your answer in `answers_t4`. Using your skills of interpretation of figures, it would appear that:

1. In 2019, in general, overall happiness scores increase as social support increases.
2. In 2019, in general, overall happiness scores increase as social support decreases.
3. In 2019, in general, overall happiness scores decrease as social support increases.
4. In 2019, in general, there is no relationship between social support and happiness.

```{r T04}
answers_t4 <- 1
```

### Task 5 - Replicating Figures

In the `T05` code chunk, replace the `NULL`s to exactly replicate the figure shown in the 'Ch3_Task5_ReplicatingFigures.html' file that was included in the ZIP-file you downloaded depicting Happiness Score as a function of Social Support. Each individual country should be shown as a downward-pointing triangle with each region represented by a separate color (i.e. countries from the same region have the same color).


```{r T05}
ggplot(happy19, aes(x = Social.Support, y = Happiness.Score)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region), shape = 6) + 
  theme_bw()
```

### Task 6 - Individual panels

In the `T06` code chunk, using one line of code, adapt the figure in Task 5 so that this time you have individual scatterplots for each region. You should have 10 individual scatterplots in your Figure, with each scatterplot an individual panels. Don't worry if the names don't fit the panel size. Keep the same theme and color as stated in Task 5, but feel free to change the shape. 


```{r T06}
ggplot(happy19, aes(x = Social.Support, y = Happiness.Score)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Region), shape = 6)+
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Region)
```

### Task 7 - Regions with not so many countries

In the `T07` code chunk, replace the `NULL` with three lines of code that are piped together (i.e., `%>%`) so that `happy19_big_regions` contains the `mean_happiness` scores for **only** the Regions with less than **8** countries in them. The three columns of `happy19_big_regions` **MUST** be titled `Region`, `n`, and `mean_happiness`, but in any order is fine right now. The column `n` must show the number of countries in each region.


```{r T07}
happy19_big_regions <- happy19 %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  filter(n() < 8) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean_happiness = mean(Happiness.Score))
```

### Task 8 - Interpretation 2

In the `T08` code chunk, replace the `NULL`, with the number from the list below, of the region with the lowest `mean_happiness` score in `happy19_big_regions`, storing your answer in `answers_t8`. For example, if you thought Central and Eastern Europe had the lowest mean happiness then you would change the `NULL` to 1.

1. Central and Eastern Europe
2. Eastern Asia
3. Latin America and Caribbean
4. Middle East and Northern Africa
5. Australia and New Zealand
6. North America
7. Southeastern Asia
8. Southern Asia
9. Sub-Saharan Africa
10. Western Europe

```{r T08}
answers_t8 <- 8
```

### Task 9 - Happy Neighbours Near and Far

Let's finish by looking at the Happiness Score of some neighbouring countries and compare them to the UK. Using one line of code with two functions joined by a pipe (%>%), in the `T09` code chunk, replace the `NULL` to first **filter** the five countries named below into `happy19_neighs`, and then **select** only the columns Country and Happiness. Score in that order.

Keep only the following five countries and in this order: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States 


```{r T09}
happy19_neighs <- happy19 %>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Australia" , "Canada", "New Zealand", "United Kingdom", "United States")) %>%
  select(Country, Happiness.Score)
```

### Task 10 - Plotting Happy Neighbours

In the `T10` code chunk, replace the `NULL`s so that the figure uses the `happy19_neighs` tibble to show a barchart depicting Happiness Score (y-axis) versus Country (x-axis). Feel free to color the bars and theme the figure if you wish, but make sure it is a barchart with one column for each country.


```{r T10}
ggplot(happy19_neighs, aes(x = Country, y = Happiness.Score, fill = Country)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(0.9)) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

### Task 11 - Interpretation 3

In the `T11` code chunk, replace the `NULL` with the absolute difference in Happiness Score between the **United Kingdom** and **Canada** as shown in `Task 9 - happy19_neighs`. "Absolute difference" means to ignore whether the difference is positive or negative and enter just the value, not the sign. State the answer to two decimal places and store it in `answers_t11`.


```{r T11}
answers_t11 <- happy19_neighs %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Canada")) %>%
  select(Happiness.Score) %>% 
  mutate(diff = max(Happiness.Score) - Happiness.Score) %>%
  filter(Happiness.Score == min(Happiness.Score)) %>%
  pull(diff) %>%
  round(2)
```
