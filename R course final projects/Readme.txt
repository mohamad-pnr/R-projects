All the .rmd files you see here are the final projects I have done for University of Glascow's R course. 

I have intentionally ordered them, so everyone can understand how I progressed through the course, and it is also a sweet reminder for me of the challenges I overcame. 
You can see the trend that with each project, I have become more of an independent programmer, and that's why I haven't deleted the descriptions of the course itslef to make it easier to see the trend I mentioned.

Coding hasn't always been easy for me. But it got better with every little step.

The data used in this projects, and the accompanying textbook is available here: https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v2/

Enjoy!
