# R Course Projects â€“ University of Glasgow

This repository contains the final project submissions from my time in the **R programming course at the University of Glasgow**.

## Overview

Each `.Rmd` file included here represents a milestone in my learning journey. I have intentionally arranged the projects in the order they were completed, so that others can follow the progression and see how my understanding and confidence in programming developed over time.

You will notice that the project descriptions from the course have been preserved. I chose to retain them to better highlight the evolution in my problem-solving approach and programming independence.

## Personal Note

Learning to code has not always come easily to me, but with each project, I gained more confidence. These files serve both as a learning resource for others and as a personal reminder of the challenges I have worked through.

## Course Materials

The datasets used in these projects, along with the accompanying textbook, are freely available at the following link:
