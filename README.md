# R-projects
A repository sharing R code for advanced statistics for others to use and learn.

This repository is a place in which I share my latest codes in R, in this ever-lasting journey of learning it. 
I share .rmd codes mostly.
This repository is protected under MIT Liscence. If you feel the need to have the data I worked with, send me a message so I can send them to you. 

Enjoy!
